  This New York City Times Square hotel, a stylish four diamond boutique hotel, features
  200 uniquely styled guestrooms and suites that are sinfully spacious by New York
  City standards. Making its home in the beautifully renovated, historic Leavitt Building
  just steps away from Times Square, The Muse Hotel draws guests in past the arched,
  limestone-and-brick façade, and invites them to daydream on the whimsical, overstuffed
  sofas and midnight blue velvet rolled-arm lounge chairs in the lobby.

  A limited quantity discounted hotel rate of $220 is available. Please call the hotel
  reservations at 1-877-NYC-MUSE (1-877-692-6873) and mention the Doubrovkine-Paskar
  wedding block.
