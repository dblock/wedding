  collectibles; the Library with shelves of rare Russian books alongside a lustrous sixteenth-century icon;
  ascend its grand staircase and you find The Parlor with excuisite antique chairs and empire sofas; and the
  Grand Ballroom with a doomed ceiling and skylight.

  The FireBird, an authentic pre-Revolutionary Russian restaurant. It is the culmination of a life-long dream
  of J. William Holt and his wife, Baroness Irina von der Launitz, granddaughter of Vladimir von der Launitz,
  the mayor of St.-Petersburg until his assasination in 1907. The restaurant reflects the Holt's extensive 
  knowledge of and passion for Russian art, literature and cuisine.
